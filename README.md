# RC-Plane
This is an attempt at making a remote controlled plane without any prior knowledge


WORK IN PROGRESS by a determined, but unknowledgeable high school student.


#Current TODO list
- Research the electronics required to accomplish this task
- Calculate the size and weight of the plane
- Research more on how to control the finished product (Currently thinking about using Arduino)



#Required materials list
- 2 electric motors (Main forward thrust)
- Styrofoam (Unspecified amount)
- 6 servos (For moving parts)
- 2 Electric Speed Controllers
